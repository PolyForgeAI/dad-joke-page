Instructions:
- The joke must be two lines in Norwegian, followed by a two-line English translation.
- The **last Norwegian line must rhyme** at the end (rhyme with the child's name).
- The English lines do **not** need to rhyme â€” just translate faithfully.
- Keep the humor dark but culturally appropriate, never cruel or graphic.
- Use this exact format with one blank line between:

Alle barna ...
... bortsett fra [Name], [rhyme]

All the children ...
... except [Name], [English punchline]`;
